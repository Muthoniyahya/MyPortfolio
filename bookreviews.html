        In the book Born a Crime by Trevor Noah, humor is portrayed where Trevor describes how many services
        he had to attend on Sundays, an evangelical mixed-race church, a mainline white church, and a black church. and
        even named his mother as team Jesus.
        Trevor Noah describes the Incidence where his mother threw him out of a moving car. The driver of the vehicle
        took offense at the fact that Trevor’s black mother had made a child with a white man and threatened. Humor is
        shown where the mom quickly throws him out of the car without alerting him and they had to run. Trevor says
        “nobody ran like me and my mom”.
        We find that Trevor pooped in the kitchen since it was raining and he didn’t feel like going outside, nobody has
        a clue that he’s the one who did the awful act to a point where the mom thinks it’s a demon after listening to
        the story. The family calls out for neighbors living around the area so that they can cast the demon out. Humor
        is seen where Trevor is asked to pray and he says “Dear Lord, please protect us, from whoever who did this since
        we don’t know exactly and maybe is a big misunderstanding and we shouldn’t be quick to judge when we don’t know
        the whole story”.
        Trevor’s friend Tom invites him out and tells him to wear his best outfit. Little did he know it was a plan for
        him to perform on a gig and act like an American star who goes by the name Spliff Star since the audience had
        already paid money and Tom convinced them that a very famous American star is coming to perform.
        One morning before mass Trevor decided to snick behind the altar and drank the entire bottle of grape juice and
        ate the entire bag of Eucharist to make up for all the other times he couldn’t. This act annoyed the principal
        to a point where he asked “What kind of a sick person would eat all of Jesus’s body and drink all of Jesus’s
        blood?”.Trevor Noah answers him back by telling him a hungry person would do that.
        It reaches a point where Trevor’s mom is tired so she decides to write and leave letters for Trevor to read
        them. She was complaining about his grades since his performance had declined and was terrible. Trevor replies
        to his mom’s writing by saying “It is extremely unfair, especially because you were not very good in school and
        so in part, you are to blame because if you were good in school, why would I be good and we are genetically the
        same. Gran always talks of how naughty you were, so my naughtiness comes from you.

         In the novel Born a Crime, we are introduced to a character named Abel who gets to marry Patricia who
        is Trevor’s mom and we find that the relationship becomes toxic because Abel wants to be the head and expects
        his wife to be submissive too. Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife.
        We find that when Abel marries Trevor’s mom he set new rules in the house that were strict. He kicked Fufi and
        Panther out of the house and made it very clear that no dogs are meant to be in the house and in African homes
        dogs are meant to stay outside.
        Patricia was still the free spirit doing what she wanted, going where she wanted but as time passed by things
        changed and she was forced not to go to church and attend services the whole day like she used to. He stopped
        fixing Patricia’s car so as to prevent her from going to church. Abel becomes the only means of transport and
        refuses Patricia’s car to be fixed by another mechanic also he refuses to take them to places saying that they
        are insulting his manhood.
        Trevor stopped seeing his father since Abel refused the reason being he does not want his wife to be seen by
        another man and keeps on dragging the issue of what will his friends say. The home turned into a space of
        violence since Abel was a drunkard and he never cared about providing anything for the family. Patricia ended up
        paying for all the bills and all the money Abel earned he bought beers. One day Abel almost burned down the
        house because he was drunk and when Trevor’s mom sensed smoke and woke up Abel but instead he slapped her.
        Trevor’s mom gave her all to support Abel’s business but all the money was used for drinking. Things changed and
        it was hard to afford meals but Abel didn’t care. Patricia came in for him and tried to bring the garage back to
        life. The business resumed back to normal and people were really amazed by her work and even complimented her
        while chatting with Abel. His anger always became the best of him and he’d always end up beating up his wife
        with the mindset that she’s disrespecting him and people think that she works better than him.
        Anger controls Abel and it’s hard for Patricia to leave the marriage because he loves him and she always prays
        for him hoping that he’ll change but he gets worse each and every day. Abel gets jealous when he finds his wife
        attending to men in the garage and ends up hitting the customers and chasing them away. Trevor is unable to
        tolerate Abel’s bad behaviors and ends up blaming his mom for everything that was happening around her
        surrounding.
        Abel on the other hand is a dictator and expects everyone in the home to bow to him and be submissive. We find
        that in the relationship there’s violence and when Patricia reports to the authority she’s not considered simply
        because she’s a lady and women don’t have any status in the society they are just wives. Patricia really holds
        on to Abel but violence increases each and every day and the injuries are severe since she was hit on the head
        with a bicycle.
        According to my opinion, independent ladies go through a lot of struggles and violence most of their marriages
        don’t succeed since they are considered as a threat by men. We’ve been leaving in male-dominated homes and
        villages too where women are not considered and the only niche they occupy is doing house chores, getting
        married, and producing children.
        Most men prefer marrying women who will bow to their demands and rules but they often leave their wives at home
        and go party with other ladies who don’t vary in terms of character. I feel like women should be given the
        opportunity to choose the kind of men they want to spend the rest of their lives with since marriage is a
        choice.
