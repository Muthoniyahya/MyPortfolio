            Iman Yahya is a 18 year old born in the year 2002 in Nairobi county.Growing up was fun and challenging
            too.I started schooling in Lizpal Academy for my lower primary studies, later I was shifted to Milimani
            school where I completed my primary life.In 2016 I joined St.Agnes Girls Kiranja High school and did my
            highschool course.I made new friends and my life changed since there was lots of interactions and debates
            which challenged me mentally also it helped in boosting my confidence.In terms of school activities I was
            not left out,i really loved drama and music which made my highschool life more exciting.In terms of the
            school-curriculum I did all the courses but majored in sciences,humanity and languages that helped me in
            boosting my performance.2019 was the year I completed my highschool level and joined AkiraChix an year later.
            My hobbies include swimming,reading novels and cooking.It helps me in relaxing and enables me to feel good whenever i'm stressed.My goal is to secure a well paying job and to improve on the skills that i will acquire at the end of the programme.
